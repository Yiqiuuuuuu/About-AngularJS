<!--
Syntax:
<element ng-bind-html="expression"></element>

"expression" --- specifies a variable, or an expression to evaluate
-->

<!--
The ng-bind-html directive is a secure way of binding content to an HTML element.

When you are letting AngularJS write HTML in your application, you should check the HTML for dangerous code. By including the "angular-sanitize.js" module in your application you can do so by running the HTML code through the ngSanitize function.
